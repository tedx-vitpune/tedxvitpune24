        TED is a non-profit organization devoted to Ideas Worth Spreading.
        It started as a four-day conference in California 39 years ago,
        believing passionately in the power of ideas to change attitudes
        and lives and welcoming people from every discipline and culture
        who seek a deeper understanding of the world. Today, the two
        annual TED Conferences invite the world's leading thinkers and
        doers to speak for 18 minutes or less, and the total number of
        events conducted till now is more than 6000. All this has led to a
        global community focused on change through the power of ideas,
        thus forming a trinity of ideas from- Technology, Entertainment,
        and Design, and has recently taken up a broader scope ranging from
        science and business to global issues.

      <p className="ted1para">
        In the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TEDx is a TED-created
        program of local, self-organized events that bring people together
        to share a TED-like experience. These events are community driven
        and are organized by passionate individuals who seek to uncover
        new ideas and share the latest research in their field of
        expertise that spark conversations in their communities and
        ultimately elevate them to a global stage. TEDx events aim to
        integrate ideas from every nook and corner of the world, thus,
        extending the boundaries of views and ideas. Our event is named
        TEDxVITPune, where x = independently organized TED event. The TED
        Conference provides general guidance for the TEDx program, but
        individual TEDx events, including ours, are self-organized.
